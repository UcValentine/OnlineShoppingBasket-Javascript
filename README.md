# OnlineShoppingBasket-Javascript

The page shown in the creative depicts a user’s basket on a fictitious online shopping site. Three products have been added to the basket and the names of these are shown together with their cost and the quantity desired for purchase. 

Beneath the product list, a sub-total of the product costs are shown, VAT is then added (at 20%) and the total is shown beneath. 

Finally, a ‘Buy Now’ button allows the user to go ahead and purchase the items shown at the total price given.
